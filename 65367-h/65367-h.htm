<span class="largefont">The Science of Foretelling Future Events
by Dreams.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Since the world began, “coming events have
cast shadows before,” and many of the important
incidents in our lives are shown us in
our dreams if we only understood their full
interpretation.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the most certain
signs, and can almost invariably be relied
upon. For dreams not mentioned here, a
pleasant dream almost invariably indicates
good health, successful ventures and general
prosperity, while evil dreams are forebodings
of ill health and other troubles.</p>

<p>Abuse.&mdash;To dream that you are abused and
insulted is a certain sign you will have a dispute
with some person with whom you have
business, and, after such a dream, you should
be particularly careful to be as gentle and mild
as possible, that you may not give those with
whom you have dealings any advantage over
you; if you are in love, be assured that some
one has attempted to injure you with the object
of your affections, and that they have in a
great measure succeeded. You should, therefore,
after such a dream, be particularly attentive;
eradicate the unfavorable impressions
that have been made; if you have a lawsuit,
keep a sharp lookout after your attorney, for<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
such a dream, in that case, denotes that he is
endeavoring to sell your cause; avoid taking a
journey by land, or a voyage by sea, for eight
and forty hours, because such a dream forebodes
accidents by travelling.</p>

<p>Abraham.&mdash;To dream of Abraham denotes
good fortune, accumulation of riches; in love,
many rivals; in law, many difficulties, an increase
in your business. He may give you
some valuable information how to avoid trouble.</p>

<p>Adam.&mdash;To dream of Adam is a particularly
good omen, and brings good fortune to the
dreamer.</p>

<p>Adversary.&mdash;To dream you meet with an
adversary denotes that you will overcome some
obstacle to your happiness; if you are a lover,
you will conquer some powerful rival, and be
happy in your love; your affairs are going on
well; if you are in trade, an increase of business;
if you quarrel, and he overcomes you, it
is a good sign, for you will conquer all obstacles
to your promotion, happiness and fortune;
but, if you conquer him, then you will never
rise to any great preferment by the means you
are at present adopting; many things will miscarry
with you, but in general you will be fortunate.</p>

<p>Acquaintance.&mdash;To dream you quarrel or
fight with an acquaintance is unlucky; it forebodes
a division amongst your own family,<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
much to the injury and prejudice of the
dreamer; if you are in love, your sweetheart
will prove unfaithful, and marry some one
else; if you are in business, heavy loss will
befall you, and you will disagree with some of
your best friends on the most trivial matters;
if you have a law-suit, your attorney will neglect
you, your witnesses will be tardy and
backward, and finally you will lose your cause.
Do not for some time undertake a journey by
land, or a voyage by sea, or enter into new
undertakings, for you will be unsuccessful;
leave, if you can, your present place of residence,
and, above all, avoid lending money,
for you will surely lose it, together with the
friendship of those to whom you lend it.</p>

<p>Angels.&mdash;To dream you see angels in your
sleep is a sure sign that one is near you, therefore
be mindful of the rest of your dream, for
it will come to pass pretty accurately; should
you dream you see an angel, or angels, then it
denotes health, prosperity, and much happiness,
with many children who will turn out good. If
you are in love, nothing can be more favorable,
and all your undertakings will prosper and be
advantageous to you.</p>

<p>Apparitions.&mdash;To dream you see a ghost,
hobgoblin, spectre, and such kind of things, is
of a very unfortunate nature, they denote vexation
and disappointment; if you are in love, it
is a certain sign of your not being beloved in
return. Some one is about to deceive you and<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
you are friendly with one who is your most inveterate
enemy; do not undertake a journey,
for it will be unfortunate for you; be careful of
contracting debts, for such a dream forebodes
great trouble through some one to whom you
shall owe money.</p>

<p>Asps.&mdash;To dream of asps denotes that you
will become extremely rich, and have great
quantities of money by you; if you are in love,
it imports that your love will be returned, and
that your sweetheart will become through your
means extremely wealthy.</p>

<p>Bagpipes.&mdash;To dream of this instrument of
Scottish music indicates that the dreamer will
experience great trouble, and that he will labor
to little purpose; in love, it denotes that the
marriage state will be full of cares, and that
you will in it experience much poverty and
distress.</p>

<p>Basin.&mdash;To dream you are eating or drinking
out of a basin is a certain sign that you will
soon be in love, but without great care you will
not marry the first object of your affections; it
denotes prosperity in your trade; and to the
farmer, a good crop.</p>

<p>Bathing.&mdash;To dream you are bathing yourself
in clear water denotes happiness, prosperity,
and success in love; if the water is dirty,
then it foretells shame and sorrow, and a disappointment
in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Beans.&mdash;To dream of beans is an unfavorable
dream, it is the forerunner of troubles and
quarrels; if you are in love, expect a difference
between you and your sweetheart.</p>

<p>Bees.&mdash;To dream of them has a variety of interpretations
according to their different situations.
To dream they sting you denotes loss of
good character, and, if you are in love, of your
sweetheart.</p>

<p>To dream you see them at work is very
lucky, and means success by your industry; if
you are in love, you will marry the object of
your affections. To dream you see them making
their honey under your own roof is the
best omen in the world, it denotes riches, a good
husband or wife, good children, whatever you
undertake will be prosperous. For the rich to
dream of bees is rather unlucky; but to the
poor they denote comfort, affluence and success.</p>

<p>Beheading.&mdash;To dream you see any one beheaded
is a good omen; if you are in love, you
will marry the object of your affections; if you
are in trouble of any kind, it will speedily vanish;
it denotes, also, that you will see some
friend who has long been absent, and that he
will be in good health.</p>

<p>Bells.&mdash;To dream you hear the bells ringing
denotes a speedy marriage, and that you will
receive some very good news.</p>

<p>Buildings.&mdash;To dream of being amongst
buildings denotes that you will change your<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
present place of residence, and that you will
make many new friends in life; if you are in
love, it foretells your sweetheart is about to remove
at a distance from you, and that you will
be in danger of losing the affections of your
lover by new faces.</p>

<p>Cats.&mdash;To dream of these domestic animals
is indicative of much trouble and vexation; it
denotes to the lover that your sweetheart is
treacherous; if you keep servants, they are unfaithful
and will rob you. To dream you kill
a cat denotes that you will discover a thief, and
prosecute him to conviction; expect, also, to
lose your own liberty through the insincerity
of some pretended friend.</p>

<p>Climbing.&mdash;To dream you are climbing a tree
denotes some honor in the State, and success in
life; if you are in love, you will marry your
sweetheart after a long courtship. To dream
you are climbing up a very steep hill or place
foretells many difficulties and much sickness;
if you reach the top, you will get over all your
difficulties, and recover from your illness; but
if you awake before you have attained the top,
you will be disappointed in love and other projects
in life, and die in your next illness.</p>

<p>Church.&mdash;To dream of a church is portentous
of evil. If you are in a church during
divine service, you will be engaged in a lawsuit
or some quarrel that will very near ruin
you; if you are in love, your sweetheart is
unfaithful, and prefers another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Dancing.&mdash;To dream you are dancing at a
ball, wake or entertainment foretells that you
will shortly receive some joyful news from a
long absent friend, or that you are about to
inherit some unexpected legacy; it foretells
success and happiness in love; your sweetheart
is kind and true, and will make you very
happy in marriage; increase of children to married
persons, and of business to those in trade.</p>

<p>Darkness.&mdash;To dream you are in a very dark
place, or that you are in the dark, is a very
unfavorable omen; to the lover, it denotes the
loss of your sweetheart; to the trader, loss by
debts, business; to the farmer, bad crops; to
the sailor, shipwreck and misfortune. To
dream you get out of darkness into light denotes
good to the dreamer; if you are in poverty,
you will rise to riches and honor; if you
are in love, it denotes a happy marriage and
many children, with an industrious husband or
wife; expect also to hear some glad tidings
from a far distant country.</p>

<p>Earthquake.&mdash;To dream of an earthquake
warns you that your affairs are about to take a
very great change; if you see many houses
tumbled into ruins, then it will be much for the
better; should the houses appear to stand, then
for the worse; for the lover, it foretells that
your sweetheart is about to take a journey, and
that it is a chance if you ever see each other
again.</p>

<p>Eating.&mdash;To dream you are eating is a very<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
unfavorable omen; it portends disunion
amongst your family, losses in trade, and
disappointment in love. To see others eating
is of a contrary tendency, and foretells success
in all your present enterprises; that your
sweetheart is kind and faithful, and if you
marry the present object of your affections that
you will grow rich, be happy and have dutiful
children.</p>

<p>Fall.&mdash;To dream you fall from any very
high place, or from a tree, denotes loss of place
and goods; if you are in love, it surely indicates
that you will never marry the present object
of your affections; to the tradesman, it
denotes a decline of business, and to the sailor,
storms and shipwreck.</p>

<p>Fighting.&mdash;To dream you are fighting denotes
to the lover that you will lose the object of your
affections through a foolish quarrel; it also
forebodes much opposition to your wishes, with
loss of character and property. After such a
dream you should leave your present situation,
because such a dream indicates that you will
not prosper in it; to the sailor it denotes storms
and shipwreck, with disappointment in love.</p>

<p>Fire.&mdash;To dream of this subtle element denotes
health and happiness to the lover, marriage
with the object of your affections, and
many children; you will be very angry with
some one on a trifling occasion. Burning lights
descending, as it were from heaven, are a very
bad sign; it portends some dreadful accident&mdash;having<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
your brains dashed out, breaking your
legs, getting into prison, or other strange accidents;
to the lover it also denotes the loss of
the affections of your sweetheart; to the tradesman
bad fortune in business. To dream that
you are burnt by fire denotes great danger, and
that enemies will injure you.</p>

<p>Fishing.&mdash;To dream you are fishing is a sure
sign of sorrow and trouble; if you catch any
fish you will be successful in love and business;
if you catch none you will never marry your
present sweetheart, nor succeed in your present
undertakings; if they slip out of your hands
after you have caught them, the person you
marry will be of a roving disposition, and some
pretended friend will deceive you.</p>

<p>Flowers.&mdash;To dream you are gathering flowers
is a very favorable omen; expect to thrive
in everything you undertake, and that you will
be successful in love, marry happily, and have
beautiful children; should they wither under
your hands, then heavy losses in trade; that
your sweetheart will die; or, if you are married,
that you will lose your husband or wife, and
also your favorite child.</p>

<p>Fortune.&mdash;To dream you make a sudden fortune
is a very bad omen; to the tradesman it
forbodes losses in trade and quarreling with his
creditors; to the lover, it denotes that your
sweetheart does not return your love. To
dream you are acquiring a fortune is favorable,
it portends a good legacy and success in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>Garden.&mdash;To dream you are walking in a
garden is of a very favorable nature; it portends
elevation in fortune and dignity; to the
lover it denotes great success and an advantageous
marriage; to the tradesman it promises
increase of business; to the farmer, plentiful
crops.</p>

<p>Gifts.&mdash;To dream you have anything given
you is a sign that some good is about to happen
to you; it also denotes that a speedy marriage
will take place betwixt you and your sweetheart.
To dream you have given anything
away is the forerunner of adversity; and in
love denotes sickness and inconstancy in your
sweetheart or partner.</p>

<p>Horses.&mdash;To dream of these useful animals
is good; if you are mounted on a fine horse,
you will marry a rich person, who will do well,
and make you happy; it shows change in life;
if you fall from your horse difficulties will
occur, and some unexpected disaster befall you.</p>

<p>Knives.&mdash;To dream of knives is a very
unpropitious omen; it betokens law-suits, poverty,
disgrace, strife, and a general failure in
the pursuit of your projects; in love, it shows
that your sweetheart is of a bad temper, and
unfaithful, and that if you marry, you will
live in enmity and misery.</p>

<p>Marriage.&mdash;To dream you are married is
ominous of death, and very unfavorable to the
dreamer; it denotes poverty, a prison, and misfortunes.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
To dream you assist at a wedding
is the forerunner of some pleasing news and
great success. To dream of lying with your
newly married husband or wife threatens danger
and sudden misfortunes, and also that you
will lose a part of your property.</p>

<p>Shoes.&mdash;To dream you have a new pair of
shoes denotes much success in life and
triumph over your enemies; in love, a speedy
marriage and infidelity. In the married state,
an increase of children. To dream your shoes
are worn out and bad, shows decay in circumstances
and loss of friends; in love, it foretells
the infidelity of your lover, who will marry another.</p>

<p>Silk.&mdash;To dream you see silk, either in pieces
or for sewing, signifies prosperity and success
in undertakings; to the lover, it denotes a
sweetheart of an industrious disposition, good
tempered, and very faithful; in trade, it foretells
increase of business, by means of women.
To be clothed in silk foretells honors and
riches, but you will quarrel with a rich neighbor,
who will endeavor to do you mischief.
For a married woman to dream of being dressed
in a silk gown, shows her husband is fond of
some one who will nearly ruin him. If a
maiden dreams of it, she will speedily see her
lover.</p>

<p>Silver.&mdash;To dream of this valuable metal
shows that false friends are about you, and
will attempt your ruin; in love, it denotes<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
falsehood in your sweetheart. To receive or
pick up pieces of silver money, if they are small,
denotes want and a prison; if they are quarters,
they indicate the receipt of a small sum of
money, and the acquisition of some new friends;
but if they are half-dollars or dollars, they denote
misery, a prison and failure in your undertakings,
disappointment in your love, and loss
of law-suits, attacks from thieves and bankruptcy
in trade. If a woman with child dreams
of silver, it shows she will have a girl, but the
child will grow poor.</p>

<p>Singing.&mdash;To dream you are singing shows
that you will hear shortly some very melancholy
news; to the lover, your sweetheart is
bad tempered and unfaithful; to the tradesman,
losses by sharpers. To dream that you only
hear singing and merry making shows that
you will have some agreeable news from a person
long absent; if you are in a prison, it foretells
you will speedily regain your liberty.</p>

<p>Tombs.&mdash;To dream of being amongst the
tombs denotes a speedy marriage, great success
in business, and the gaining of a lawsuit; also
the birth of children, and unexpected news.</p>

<p>Treasure.&mdash;To dream you find a treasure in
the earth is very ominous; it shows that you
will be betrayed by your bosom friend; your
sweetheart is unfaithful and deceives you; if
you should not be able to carry it away, you
will have some very heavy losses; if you have<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
lawsuit it will go against you by the treachery
of your attorney.</p>

<p>Trees.&mdash;To dream you see trees in blossom
denotes a happy marriage with the present object
of your affections, and many children who
will do extremely well in life; to the tradesman
it denotes success in business. To dream you
are climbing trees denotes that you will make
a fortune, and rise to honors and dignities in
the State. To dream you are cutting down
trees foretells the death of a near relation or
dear friend.</p>

<p>Walking.&mdash;To dream you are walking in a
dirty, muddy place foretells sickness and vexation;
to the lover it denotes your sweetheart to
be bad tempered and unfaithful; to the tradesman
it foretells dishonest servants, and loss of
goods by fire.</p>

<p>Water.&mdash;To dream you are drinking water
denotes great trouble and adversity; in trade,
loss of business, and being arrested; to the
lover it shows your sweetheart is false, prefers
another, and will never marry you.</p>

<p>Wedding.&mdash;To dream of being married, or
at a wedding, is a very unfavorable dream, especially
for lovers; it denotes the death of some
dear friend or relation, with loss of property
and severe disappointment.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
